# NoteTaker

This application provides users the ability to create and keep track of notes with a polished interface. It utilizes express.js to pair client-side input and activity with requests to a basic server which can serve up current notes, and a note, or delete a note from the user's collection. The very basic note database accessed by the server allows for persistence of user notes across sessions.
